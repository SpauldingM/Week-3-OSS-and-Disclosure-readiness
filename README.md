# Week-3-OSS-and-Disclosure-readiness

## <ins>License Choice:</ins>
For personal uses, I would recommend and plan on using Apache for future plans of designing any open source softwares. The reasons being:
Apache allows the user full ability to do what they want with the program; Use, modify and distribute.
The licensing also comes with its own patent, protecting them against any lawsuits
While Apache gives the user freedom to design, modify and distribute freely, it must be done with credit given to the original developer.

## <ins>Justification:</ins>
The Apache license is a strong choice for an OSS as it grants the user in what could be described as freedom with protection. The license is said to allow the user the ability to be able to freely use, modify and distribute the code or the program that uses it's licensing freely. The only downside to it would be the need to credit the original source, but that is rather minor compared to the ability of what could be compared to "Freedom".

## Reflection:
Overall, it was great getting to learn about the most popular versions of licensing and what all you can do with them. I will be looking forward to learning more and potentially using one of these licenses, preferably Apache, if and when I go into the OSS. I also look forward into improving vulnerability report forms or professional forms in general.
