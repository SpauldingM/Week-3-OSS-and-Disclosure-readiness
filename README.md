# Week-3-OSS-and-Disclosure-readiness

## <ins>License Choice:</ins>
For personal uses, I would recommend and plan on using Apache for future plans of designing any open source softwares. The reasons being:
Apache allows the user full ability to do what they want with the program; Use, modify and distribute.
The licensing also comes with its own patent, protecting them against any lawsuits
While Apache gives the user freedom to design, modify and distribute freely, it must be done with credit given to the original developer.
